# A bit of history

JS Bin is a webapp specifically designed to help JavaScript and CSS folk test
snippets of code, within some context, and debug the code collaboratively.

The original idea spawned from a conversation with another developer in trying to
help him debug an Ajax issue. Pastebins didn't exist with the live output
so Remy decided to build one.

Version 1 of JS Bin took the best part of 4 hours to develop back in October 2008,
version 2 released in October 2009 was been rewritten from the ground up and was
completely open source, and version 3 was released in June 2012 with live
rendering, codecasting and remote rendering.
